          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
              I am a Renaisssance man.  I have a Bachelor's Degree in Philosphy from Rutgers University.  I spent around 15 years as a fencing master and a teacher. 
              I thoroughly enjoyed my time educating the next generation, and I have developed a strong understanding of leadership, management, and many strategies 
              for teaching others complex concepts. But I felt like a square peg who found a way to fit himself seamlessly into a round hole.  I began searching, and 
              I've now found my place in the world of coding and web design.  I am excited to see where it goes from here.

          <h2>GitHub</h2>
          <p>
              This is my GitHub profile.  It is ever-growing, ever-changing, and ever-improved, just like the field of web design and coding!  Take a look around and see some 
              of the projects I've completed or that I'm working on.  Some of them are simple, some more complex, but I'm proud of it all, even if it's just because I can look 
              back and see how far I've come!

          <h2>Resume</h2>
          <p>
              This is my linkedin resume.  It will be updated soon to reflect my completion of the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp, and hopefully will look impressive by the time I 
              and the career counsellors are done fiddling with it.  I want a real solid looking and sounding resume!

              This is my other section.  It is ever-growing, ever-changing, and ever-improved, just like the field of web design and coding!  Take a look around and see some 
              of the projects I've completed or that I'm working on.  Some of them are simple, some more complex, but I'm proud of it all, even if it's just because I can look 
              back and see how far I've come!  This is a small sample of some of the work I've done.  This is the forward-facing user experience.  Click on any image to go to the website.
